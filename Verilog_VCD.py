# =head1 NAME
#
# Verilog_VCD - Parse a Verilog VCD text file
#
# =head1 VERSION
#
# This document refers to Verilog::VCD version 1.10.
#
# =head1 SYNOPSIS
#
#     from Verilog_VCD import parse_vcd
#     vcd = parse_vcd('/path/to/some.vcd')
#
# =head1 DESCRIPTION
#
# Verilog is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) used to model digital logic.
# While simulating logic circuits, the values of signals can be written out to
# a Value Change Dump (VCD) file.  This module can be used to parse a VCD file
# so that further analysis can be performed on the simulation data.  The entire
# VCD file can be stored in a Python data structure and manipulated using
# standard hash and array operations.  This module is also a good helper for
# parsing fsdb files, since you can run fsd2vcd(part of the novas installation)
# to convert them to the vcd format and then use this module.
#
# =head2 Input File Syntax
#
# The syntax of the VCD text file is described in the documentation of
# the IEEE standard for Verilog.  Only the four-state VCD format is supported.
# The extended VCD format (with strength information) is not supported.
# Since the input file is assumed to be legal VCD syntax, only minimal
# validation is performed.
#
# =head1 SUBROUTINES
#
#
# =head2 parse_vcd(file, $opt_ref)
#
# Parse a VCD file and return a reference to a data structure which
# includes hierarchical signal definitions and time-value data for all
# the specified signals.  A file name is required.  By default, all
# signals in the VCD file are included, and times are in units
# specified by the C<$timescale> VCD keyword.
#
#     vcd = parse_vcd('/path/to/some.vcd')
#
# It returns a reference to a nested data structure.  The top of the
# structure is a Hash-of-Hashes.  The keys to the top hash are the VCD
# identifier codes for each signal.  The following is an example
# representation of a very simple VCD file.  It shows one signal named
# C<chip.cpu.alu.clk>, whose VCD code is C<+>.  The time-value pairs
# are stored as an Array-of-Tuples, referenced by the C<tv> key.  The
# time is always the first number in the pair, and the times are stored in
# increasing order in the array.
#
#     {
#       '+' : {
#                'tv' : [
#                          (
#                            0,
#                            '1'
#                          ),
#                          (
#                            12,
#                            '0'
#                          ),
#                        ],
#                'nets' : [
#                            {
#                              'hier' : 'chip.cpu.alu.',
#                              'name' : 'clk',
#                              'type' : 'reg',
#                              'size' : '1'
#                            }
#                          ]
#              }
#     }
#
# Since each code could have multiple hierarchical signal names, the names are
# stored as an Array-of-Hashes, referenced by the C<nets> key.  The example above
# only shows one signal name for the code.
#
#
# =head3 OPTIONS
#
# Options to C<parse_vcd> should be passed as a hash reference.
#
# =over 4
#
# =item timescale
#
# It is possible to scale all times in the VCD file to a desired timescale.
# To specify a certain timescale, such as nanoseconds:
#
#     vcd = parse_vcd(file, opt_timescale='ns'})
#
# Valid timescales are:
#
#     s ms us ns ps fs
#
# =item siglist
#
# If only a subset of the signals included in the VCD file are needed,
# they can be specified by a signal list passed as an array reference.
# The signals should be full hierarchical paths separated by the dot
# character.  For example:
#
#     signals = [
#         'top.chip.clk',
#         'top.chip.cpu.alu.status',
#         'top.chip.cpu.alu.sum[15:0]',
#     ]
#     vcd = parse_vcd(file, siglist=signals)
#
# Limiting the number of signals can substantially reduce memory usage of the
# returned data structure because only the time-value data for the selected
# signals is loaded into the data structure.
#
# =item use_stdout
#
# It is possible to print time-value pairs directly to STDOUT for a
# single signal using the C<use_stdout> option.  If the VCD file has
# more than one signal, the C<siglist> option must also be used, and there
# must only be one signal specified.  For example:
#
#     vcd = parse_vcd(file,
#                     use_stdout=1,
#                     siglist=['top.clk']
#                 )
#
# The time-value pairs are output as space-separated tokens, one per line.
# For example:
#
#     0 x
#     15 0
#     277 1
#     500 0
#
# Times are listed in the first column.
# Times units can be controlled by the C<timescale> option.
#
# =item only_sigs
#
# Parse a VCD file and return a reference to a data structure which
# includes only the hierarchical signal definitions.  Parsing stops once
# all signals have been found.  Therefore, no time-value data are
# included in the returned data structure.  This is useful for
# analyzing signals and hierarchies.
#
#     vcd = parse_vcd(file, only_sigs=1)
#
# =back
#
#
# =head2 list_sigs(file)
#
# Parse a VCD file and return a list of all signals in the VCD file.
# Parsing stops once all signals have been found.  This is
# helpful for deciding how to limit what signals are parsed.
#
# Here is an example:
#
#     signals = list_sigs('input.vcd')
#
# The signals are full hierarchical paths separated by the dot character
#
#     top.chip.cpu.alu.status
#     top.chip.cpu.alu.sum[15:0]
#
# =head2 get_timescale( )
#
# This returns a string corresponding to the timescale as specified
# by the C<$timescale> VCD keyword.  It returns the timescale for
# the last VCD file parsed.  If called before a file is parsed, it
# returns an undefined value.  If the C<parse_vcd> C<timescale> option
# was used to specify a timescale, the specified value will be returned
# instead of what is in the VCD file.
#
#     vcd = parse_vcd(file); # Parse a file first
#     ts  = get_timescale();  # Then query the timescale
#
# =head2 get_endtime( )
#
# This returns the last time found in the VCD file, scaled
# appropriately.  It returns the last time for the last VCD file parsed.
# If called before a file is parsed, it returns an undefined value.
#
#     vcd = parse_vcd(file); # Parse a file first
#     et  = get_endtime();    # Then query the endtime
#
# =head1 EXPORT
#
# Nothing is exported by default.  Functions may be exported individually, or
# all functions may be exported at once, using the special tag C<:all>.
#
# =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
#
# Error conditions cause the program to raise an Exception.
#
# =head1 LIMITATIONS
#
# Only the following VCD keywords are parsed:
#
#     $end                $scope
#     $enddefinitions     $upscope
#     $timescale          $var
#
# The extended VCD format (with strength information) is not supported.
#
# The default mode of C<parse_vcd> is to load the entire VCD file into the
# data structure.  This could be a problem for huge VCD files.  The best solution
# to any memory problem is to plan ahead and keep VCD files as small as possible.
# When simulating, dump fewer signals and scopes, and use shorter dumping
# time ranges.  Another technique is to parse only a small list of signals
# using the C<siglist> option; this method only loads the desired signals into
# the data structure.  Finally, the C<use_stdout> option will parse the input VCD
# file line-by-line, instead of loading it into the data structure, and directly
# prints time-value data to STDOUT.  The drawback is that this only applies to
# one signal.
